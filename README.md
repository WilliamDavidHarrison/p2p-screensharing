## Introduction

Backed by no server, runs entirely in the browser to chat and screenshare with a peer. It supports both mobile and desktop (screen capture may not be available on mobile). I made this app to try out Vue 3.

## How to use

The app is available [here](https://p2p-screensharing.vercel.app).

Once you have opened it on your browser, you can create a room, choose a username and share the room's link with the person you'd like to chat/screenshare with.

Screensharing is optional, you may start streaming at any time, stop streaming, change the window/screen that you're sharing. Audio capture may not be available, depending on browser.
